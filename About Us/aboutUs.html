          <p>Hi, my name is Billy Xiong. I was born Lompoc, California on October 19, 1997. When I was only 3 months old, my parents decided to move and I have lived in Monroe, Georgia ever since. Creating, adventuring, and competing have always been my favorite activities in my free time. My personal hobbies include playing soccer, fishing, hiking, reading, drawing, and binge-watching shows. Being a coder allows me to create and express my thoughts into programs and coding also challenges me to be as detailed as possible in anything I create.</p>
